abstract = {The k-means method is a widely used clustering technique that seeks to minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster. Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a very simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is $\Theta$(logk)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Preliminary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

@article{Yeung2000,
abstract = {The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that multidimensional information technologies (ITs) technologies could manifest different patterns of evolution because each dimension could be exposed to different forces of variation and selection. Commercial banks that adopted online banking services in the USA during 1995-2000 are investigated. It is found that the technical dimension of online banking services tends to converge on some agreed upon practices, but the managerial dimension does not converge. This result implies that technical choices are less likely to offer opportunities for banks to differentiate one from another. The variation in managerial choices, however, allows banks to tailor their managerial practices to better support internal operations, which can generate competitive advantages for banks. Contrary to the traditional viewpoint that these environmental dimensions evolve in a uniform direction, the paper shows that multidimensional ITs manifest different patterns of evolution.},

    abstract = { Abstract Two fuzzy versions of the k-means optimal, least squared error partitioning problem are formulated for finite subsets X of a general inner product space. In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the “fuzzy” algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the “cluster-splitting” tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions. }

Both indices increase as the pairwise distances between the subsets Xi become large compared to the diameters of Xi Maximally separated partitions p' are defined and it is shown that as the indices of p' increase without bound, the characteristic functions of Xi' in P' are approximated more and more closely by the membership functions in fuzzy partitions which minimize certain fuzzy extensions of the k-means squared error criterion function. }
